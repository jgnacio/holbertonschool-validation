* What is in the archive and how to unarchive it?

This file is generated by zip, which as output gives us a compressed file containing the dist/ folder that is generated by hugo and also contains the binary to run the API.

To unzip this file you can use unzip(on linux) or 7zip or winrar(on Windows)

* What are the commands to start and stop the application?  

make run and make stop, the first to start the application on port 9999, and the second to stop it.

* How to customize where the application logs are written?  

In the last update I added the variable LOG_FILE in Makefile, which has the name of the log file, if you want to change it modify the value of this variable.

* How to “quickly” verify that the application is running (healthcheck)?  

The api is listening for the path /health which returns "ALIVE" if it is running.
